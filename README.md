# Action_Recognition_LSTM

This project is to use LSTM to recognise actions. The code is based on "Sign Language Detection using ACTION RECOGNITION with Python | LSTM Deep Learning Model" at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDUihpj6ro

This project has been tested using visual studio code. Please take the following steps to use this project.

1. Run generate_model.data.py to prepare training data
2. Run build_model.py to create the model for action recognition. The actions used in this project is waving of right hand, left hand and both hand.
3. Run action_recognition.py to test recognise actions.
